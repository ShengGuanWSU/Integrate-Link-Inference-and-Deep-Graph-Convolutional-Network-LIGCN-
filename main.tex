%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates link inference and graph convolutional network (GCN) to detect erroneous entities in attributed networks. To actively identify potential n-hop neighbors that may contribute to the detection of local erroneous information at node $v$, we propose a general strategy that first learns ``hidden link'' called long-range dependencies between $v$ and its semantically associated neighborhood by a supervised random walk. The neighborhood of an entity is then enriched by the link prediction model to be used in the graph convolutional network. Using benchmark and real-world graphs, we experimentally verify that our framework is effective and feasible for error detection of large graphs.
