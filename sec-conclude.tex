\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclude}
In this project, we study a variant deep learning model GCN. We implement a file recommendation system based on traditional GCN model. To overcome shortcomings that are brought by the potential incompleteness of graphs, we also propose a new GCN based Model that can better capture the structure-aware representations that can be applied in the node classification task by inferring hidden links within graphs. We evaluate our proposed model on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. We observe that infereing hideen links indeed can improve the performance of the erroneous entity classification tasks.
