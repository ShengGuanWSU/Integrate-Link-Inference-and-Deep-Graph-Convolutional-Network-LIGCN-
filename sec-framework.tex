The hidden link prediction model can effectively help us capture ``hidden link" that reflect long-range dependencies between node $v$ and its semantically associated neighborhood. In this case, the neighborhood aggregation now is expected not only to aggregate topology-aware neighbors but also to aggregate semantically close neighbors that are linked via semantical edges. Traditional ConvGNNs like GCN, GraphSAGE can be enhanced by this hidden link prediction model.

We use $M$ here to generalize GCN, GraphSAGE models. The \textbf{LIGCN} framework is shown as Fig.~\ref{fig:hllM}.
