\section{Erroneous Entity Classification Problem}
\label{sec-def2}
We consider our erroneous entities classification problem as how to perform a node binary classification task with graph-based semi-supervised machine learning. Given graph $G (V,E,F_{A})$ with N Nodes  $v_i \in V$, edges $(v_i,v_j) \in E$, an  adjacency matrix $A \in R^{N * N}$,
a subset of nodes N are associated a binary label , we aims train a model M that can predict whether a node $v_i$ in graph G is erroneous or not.
